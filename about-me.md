I am a quantum complexity theorist (in training) in the Theory of Computation group at MIT CSAIL. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Anand Natarajan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf). I’ve been at MIT since 2017 and earned my B.S. in 2021 (course 6-2, renamed as 6-5 as of 2025) and M.S. in 2024 in EECS. I am grateful to be supported by the NSF GRFP (2024-2027), Doc Bedard (2023-2024) and McWhorter (2021-2022) fellowships.
