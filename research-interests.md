## Research Interests

#### Currently, I am mostly working on delegating quantum computations classically. Specifically, the problem that disturbs my slumber is that of information theoretic verification of BQP. In the past, I've worked on quantum cryptography, quantum algorithms, and quantum programming languages. A list of my publications is available on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Lr2w6oQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
