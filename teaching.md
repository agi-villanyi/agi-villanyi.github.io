## Teaching

#### Since January 2021 I've been a lead instructor for [6.S089/MIT Quantum Winter School](https://mit-qws.github.io/) over [IAP](https://mitadmissions.org/discover/the-mit-education/independent-activities-period/). In Fall 2022, I was a TA for 6.2400: Introduction to Quantum Systems Engineering. From 2021-2022 I was an instructor for [Qubit x Qubit](https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/), a quantum course for high school students organized by [The Coding School](https://the-cs.org/courses) and in 2021 I was an instructor for a quantum summer school organized by [Qbraid](https://www.qbraid.com/).
